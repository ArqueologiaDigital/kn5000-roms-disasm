# LEDGER — every hypothesis, its mask bit, and its verdict

**Read this file before starting any DSP work. It exists because ten passes on this project were
lost to re-asking a question the notes had already answered, or re-trying an approach a previous
section had already refuted.** A 6000-line register does not prevent that; an index read *first*
does.

Tiers, cheapest first — stop as soon as you have what you need:

| tier | what | where |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | the current blocker + **the dead ends** | this page, below |
| **1** | the mask-bit register — every bit, its state, its § | generated, below |
| **2** | the section index — 59 sections, one line each | generated, below |
| **3** | the sections themselves | `SPECULATIVE-APPLIED-REGISTER.md` |

⚠ Tiers 1 and 2 are **generated** by `tools/gen_ledger.py` from the C++ source and the register's
own headings, so they cannot drift. Tier 0 is hand-written. **Re-run the generator after any
section or mask-bit change**; do not hand-edit `LEDGER.md`.

## TIER 0a — THE CURRENT BLOCKER  (as of §163, 2026-07-30)

> **Kernel `iw32` re-deposits `0x400000` on the LFO phase cell every frame.**

The phase *does* increment — by 57 within the frame (`iw89`, `L = 57`) — and then does not survive
to the next. It is pinned at 2^22 = **0.5 in Q0.23**, which with the measured index scale 24
selects wavetable index **12, forever**. Every modulation effect in the machine waits on this one
write.

Both things downstream of it are **already built and verified**, waiting:

* **§161** — the LFO wavetable is intact: `m_rf[0x1D..0x40]`, 36 cells,
  `0.9500000 × 2^23 × sin(2πk/24 + 0.100000 rad)` to within 2 LSB, period exactly **24**.
* **§162** — the class-6 lookup is four lines *once the index varies*, and must not be written
  before then.

**The single next experiment**, and it is already implemented and never run to conclusion:
§112's bit 25 is **ON and its own two-sided criterion is failing**. §136 explains why and names
the untried arm — *"§112 and §40 are coupled, and neither can be right alone … the pair has never
been evaluated together."* That is **bit 54** (route the latch to `m_k`, the multiplier **input**,
instead of `m_p`, the **product**) together with **bit 4** (make the multiply read `m_k`).

```
  A control  0x3910E446A39B440F          C  +54     0x3950E446A39B440F
  B  = A (bit 25 already on)             D  +54+4   0x3950E446A39B441F
```

Two-sided criterion, from §112's own comment: **if the reading is right the phase stops being reset
and RAMPS; if it is wrong the phase stays pinned and nothing else should move either.**

## TIER 0b — ⛔ DEAD ENDS. DO NOT RETRY ANY OF THESE.

Each cost at least one full pass. The refutation is worth more than the hypothesis was.

| # | the idea | why it is dead | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix the phase clobber by changing **`DRAM_UNIT_BASE`** | **FORCED**: kernel A's walk begins where the previous frame *closed*, so base and window are coupled and `iw32` follows the cell wherever it moves. Bit 27 ran it — gate fires, `dp` `0x07`→`0x08`, **every value bit-identical** | §108 §5 |
| 2 | Decode `040.0.**.C63` / `012.4.01.1CE` as the missing phase producers | Both **already modelled**: `SRC 0x11/ACT 0x03` = `tempB ← ACCB`, `SRC 0x07/ACT 0x0E` = `P ← mem[ptr]`. Their presence in the roadmap's *"no reading of any kind"* list is a **corpus statistic, not a statement about the emulator** | §163 |
| 3 | `addr8` on the class-6 word = the **table extent** | The `0x28` sites are fed by scale `0x000010` = 16; `0x000028` does not occur in the coefficient corpus at all. The `24`/`0x18` agreement was coincidence | `lfo-ramp.md` P-16 |
| 4 | Implement the class-6 lookup **now** | Every index candidate is constant (`acc 0..0 \| m_dp 12..12 \| cursor 9..9`, 1 129 389 hits). A frozen lookup returns one entry forever, and that reads as *refuting the sine* against the "226 not 240" test | §162 |
| 5 | `SRC 0x08` = **unity** | The rival reading saturates the accumulator on the LFO's very first word. `SRC 0x08 = the COEFFICIENT` reproduces the ROM ramp constant exactly (`mem[0x04]` 1000→1228, step +228 = `0x0000E4`) in 11 of 19 corpus constants | `upd6383.cpp:2124` |
| 6 | The brief's anchors **`SRC 0x1C` = "LFO out"**, **`SRC 0x08` = "LFO phase"** | Neither is anchored anywhere in this repository, the MAME device, or its disassembler. A *word*-level landmark was read as a *field*-level one | `lfo-ramp.md` §11 |
| 7 | `st_gate = always` | 0 survivors of 276 480 | `lfo-ramp.md` P-9 |
| 8 | Remap the three internal writes onto **output ports 0/1** | Reverted: the resulting wet was rms 1.0 — a ±1 LSB constant present *even in silence* | `upd6383.cpp:2011` |
| 9 | "the delay tap **sweeps** ±240" / "each voice ramps 0→depth, a **sawtooth**" | Both retracted. The first pooled voices of opposite sign; the second censused across the boot transient. The settled modulation value is **CONSTANT** | §155, §157 → §158 |

## TIER 0c — STANDING RULES, each earned by a retraction

1. **Before reporting any non-zero output, read `§70 ACCA` and compare min against max.** Two
   "IC311 outputs audio" claims have been retracted; one was a DC. *(§137)*
2. **Report absolute audio statistics from a CLEAN vehicle** — `scratchpad/coldnotes2.lua`, cold
   boot, notes after ~19 s. The `peq_gain` vehicle *creates* a unit-1 rail through ~55 mid-run
   effect uploads; use it for **deltas only**. *(§148)*
3. **Check the owning note first — for EVERY component of a claim, not just the one you doubt.**
   Ten occurrences. §163 is the sharpest: the note was checked for the *table* and skipped for the
   *phase*, and the answer had been sitting in §108 for days.
4. **Before implementing a consumer, measure that its inputs VARY.** A datapath whose every input
   is constant cannot be validated by its output. *(§162, fourth occurrence)*
5. **An absolute event count is not a falsifier across runs** — cold-boot frame totals vary
   (1 128 480 vs 1 156 269). Pre-register the *relation between two counters*, never the literal.
   *(§161)*
6. **A reading that measures INERT is a hypothesis about a MISSING CONSUMER, not a refutation.**
   *(§156, third occurrence)*
7. **Enumerate mask bits programmatically — match the bit, not the spelling.** `grep 0x40000\b`
   missed `0x40000u` and double-booked bit 18, confounding a whole run. *(§129)*
8. **A criterion that cannot fail is not a test**, and **compute the NULL before interpreting a
   table, not after**.
9. **When the fix you reach for is an ANCHOR VALUE, stop.** Every anchor here is pinned by closure
   arithmetic; the defects are per-word **decodes**. *(§108 §5, named as a standing bias)*
