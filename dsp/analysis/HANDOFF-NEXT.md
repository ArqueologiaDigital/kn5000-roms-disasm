# HANDOFF — read this first

**Rewritten 2026-07-30 after §§127–129.** The previous version told you to select PARAMETRIC EQ
and run the transfer-function test. **PEQ is now selected, running and traced**, and that test has
been reformulated twice. Read this, then `SPECULATIVE-APPLIED-REGISTER.md` §§127–129.

---

## 1. YOUR NEXT TASK

**Make body 0 read its own coefficients, then unrail its input.** In that order — they are the two
defects standing between PARAMETRIC EQ and a scoreable audio test, and both are now localised.

1. **The coefficient-cursor rebase.** §129 measured that PEQ's bank 1 executes with the C-RAM
   cursor at `0x71`, walking **TABLE B** (the delay-tap address table, step `0x4BE` = 1214) instead
   of its biquad coefficients at `0x00..0x1D`. Bank 2 is correct only because `w58 = rstcur`
   re-bases it. Mask **bit 18** already implements the per-unit rebase
   (`m_cursor = unit1 ? 0x90 : 0x00` at the body CALL, `upd6383.cpp:3917`, motivated by
   `cram-unit-base.md` item A) and is **OFF in the default**. A/B arm = `0x6A39F440F`.
   The pre-registered prediction and its falsifiers are in the register and in
   `scratchpad/PREDICT_129.md`: **bank 1's fetched stream must become bit-identical to bank 2's,
   and bank 2 must not change** (that second half is the control whose answer is already known).
2. **The `SRC 0x08` clobber.** `iw45`/`iw32` overwrite D-RAM `0x05`/`0x07` before body 0 reads
   them. MEASURED consequence: the operand bus at `iw84` is `0x7FFFFF` — the rail — in every loud
   frame, and `unit0/DO1` presents **0 non-zero in 2 099 250 frames**. Identified in §110 and
   walked past three times since. Nothing audio-shaped can be scored until this is fixed.

## 2. What is already done, so you do not redo it

* **PEQ is selectable from the panel** (`dsp/tools/peq_gain.lua`, all MEASURED):
  `CPR_SEG3 0x04` DSP EFFECT on → `CPR_SEG10 0x04` SOUND → `CPL_SEG7 0x02` DSP EFFECT editor →
  40× `CPL_SEG10 0x10` (saturate to CHORUS) → 15× `CPL_SEG10 0x20` (up to PEQ).
  **PARAMETER down/up = `CPL_SEG8 0x10 / 0x20`; VALUE up = `CPL_SEG7 0x20`.**
  ⚠ `CPL_SEG8 0x80` is NOT PARAMETER and `CPL_SEG10 0x80` changes the *effect*.
  Boot settle ≈ 19 s emulated; use `-seconds_to_run 80`.
* **The frame trace can now see it.** It armed unconditionally at frame 420 000 (≈ 8.75 s) while
  PEQ lands at ≈ 50 s, so *every* trace ever taken of "PEQ" was a CHORUS frame.
  `UPD6383_TRACE_FRAME` sets the arm frame; 2 300 000 lands inside the held note.
* **The coefficient chain is verified**, most strongly by `dsp/tools/peq_roundtrip.py`: the ROM
  designer run forward in **float32** from the panel-stated (f0, Q, gain), scored per word —
  13 of 15 band-instances within **13 LSB of 2²⁴**, 75 words, zero free parameters.
* **Three live captures with known panel settings** are in `dsp/tools/peq_ab.py`: FLAT, FC16K
  (both exact pass-throughs — the measured null) and **G12**, the only discriminating one
  (+12 dB, Q 2, at 125 Hz). That is §128's target and it still stands.
* **The static pointer walk is confirmed live at 13/13 slots.** Bank state bases `0x50` and
  `0x64`, disjoint. ★ And **both banks read the same input cell, D-RAM `0x05`** — the "two
  channels must read two different inputs" expectation is FALSIFIED.

## 3. The four unknowns, and the one thing that changed about them

`ACT 0x0D`, `ACT 0x0E`, `f31=4`, `f31=5`, all inside PEQ's two five-word bank entries
(iw84–88 and iw134–141). **Move them together** — §121 failed by varying one while three others in
the same block were guesses.

⚠ **They are not trapping today.** With mask bit 0 set (it is), `op = f31 & 3`, so `f31=4` executes
as HI_ACC_LOAD and `f31=5` as HI_ACC_ADD; `ACT 0x0D`/`0x0E` both fall into the blanket tempA
capture. **There is no fired-count for any of this**, in violation of the project's own rule. So
any enumeration must A/B against the *alias*, not against a trap — and the alias means bank 1's
`w1` (ACT 0x0E) immediately clobbers what `w0` (ACT 0x0D) wrote.

## 4. Build / run

```
  cd ~/compartilhado/kn7000_mame && ./build.sh
      *** EXITS 0 EVEN ON COMPILE FAILURE *** -- grep for "error:" AND check
      ls -la ~/compartilhado/kn7000_mame_build/kn7000   (fresh, >70 MB)
  ./tools/publish-binary.sh
  cd ~/compartilhado/kn7000-emulator && export DISPLAY=:0 && rm -f error.log
  UPD6383_SPEC=<hex> UPD6383_TRACE_FRAME=2300000 timeout 1500 ./run.sh kn5000 \
      -window -seconds_to_run 80 -log -autoboot_script <scratchpad>/peq_gain.lua
```

* **NEVER `-video none`.** Always `timeout`-wrap. Always play notes.
* **COMPUTE masks in python, never type them, AND verify your bit is CLEAR IN THE DEFAULT.**
  Default `0x6A39B440F`, `m_specmask` is u64. Bits 0–34 are used-in-code or set-in-default and
  **bits 35–37 are §121's `ACT 0x0D` selector, extracted by shift so a grep for the hex misses
  them** — the lowest genuinely free bit is **38**.
* **Every new gate must log a FIRED-COUNT.**

## 5. The traps that keep costing time

1. **★ Check the owning note FIRST — this has now cost eight passes.** §126 declared PEQ had never
   been loaded while `kn7000_mame/notes/kn5000-dsp-origin-capture.md` had selected it in MAME a
   week earlier, with the recipe. §127 "discovered" the make-up cell that
   `kn5000-dsp-biquad-map.md` had corrected 44 minutes after the note it corrects, 8 days earlier.
   `kn5000-dsp-INDEX.md` indexes ~40 notes. Read it.
2. **A criterion that cannot fail.** §127's evidence for the make-up was `abs(h)*32` with **32 a
   hardcoded literal** — the cell was never read, so the "test" would have printed the same thing
   whatever it held. Before quoting a number, check the code actually consumes the datum.
3. **Degenerate configurations hide the thing you are testing.** At `G = 0 dB` a peaking biquad has
   numerator ≡ denominator, so the pole is recoverable from *either* cell pair and an ISO-centre
   control cannot localise which is which. Change the configuration until the thing you want to
   measure is the only thing that explains the data.
4. **A control that runs between stimulus and observation is part of the stimulus.** The soft-key
   sweep pressed each pair's restore before the next pair's snapshot and misattributed a cursor
   move by one press. One snapshot per press, no restores.
5. **Compute the NULL first.** `unit0/DO1` = 0 non-zero over 2.1 M frames was already in the log
   before any audio harness was designed.
6. **★ The quiet/loud split is contaminated in any panel-selection run.** Every cumulative census
   (§81, kwatch, pwatch, §104, §109) gates on `m_frames_run > 420000` and buckets on input≠0. In a
   run that selects PEQ at 50 s, "quiet" is ≈94 % *CHORUS-era* frames, so quiet-vs-loud is very
   nearly CHORUS-vs-PEQ and any DIFFERS verdict is uninterpretable. Make the window era-aware
   before quoting any of them.
7. **Free-running quantities fake "input dependence"**; **an inert guard is a fact about the
   configuration, not the guard**; **don't ship on one non-discriminating A/B** (§118 → §121).

## 6. Two stale claims to stop repeating

* **"Capture DO3, never the speaker mix."** The *hardware* claim survives (DO3 → HD-AE5000, not in
  the main mix). The *measurement prescription* is inverted for this build: the only writer that
  could reach `m_do[2]` is behind `if (false && …)`, so **DO3 is a constant zero**, while unit 0 —
  PARAMETRIC EQ — presents to **DO1**, which *is* summed into the speaker mix. Capture DO1 at the
  device.
* **The emulated chip runs one frame per 48 000 Hz output sample** while the firmware designs its
  biquads for **44 100**. Scale every predicted frequency by **1.0884** before comparing, or the
  poles land 8.8 % off and read as a decode error.
