# The audio gate: located at ONE word, opened behind a diagnostic (2026-09-12)

The project's #1 open item is the "4.2 audio gate" — external audio reaches the DSP but never the
effect body, so every program computes on stale state. This note localizes the break to a **single
instruction word** with a two-sided instrument, opens it behind a default-off arm, and reports what
the next blocker is. Companion to `N-SINGLE-DELAY-RECURRENCE-2026-09-12.md` (the scale thread,
which this turns out to meet).

## 1. The instrument: a frame-pair diff (`dsp/tools/frame_pair_diff.py`)
Capture frame F and frame F+1 with an otherwise identical command line and diff every D-RAM cell
and every `(iw, acc, P, L)` row. **A body fed live audio cannot produce two identical frames.**
This replaces judgement calls ("the operands look starved") with a two-sided test, and its exit
status is non-zero on a static body so it can gate a harness.

Capture (PARAMETRIC EQ, real note, unseeded):
```
DISPLAY=:0 DHLE=0 DSPCFG=3 TYPEIDX=15 NOTEMODE=0 TGM=0 UPD6383_PSHIFT=2 \
  UPD6383_TRACE_FRAME=1764000 ./kn7000 kn5000 -rompath ./roms -skip_gameinfo -log -window \
  -autoboot_script dsp/tools/fx_ab.lua ; cp error.log F.log        # then 1764001 -> F1.log
python3 dsp/tools/frame_pair_diff.py F.log F1.log --lo 0 --hi 400
```

## 2. What it measured (BASELINE, shipped device)
* **The audio arrives.** Cells `0x01` and `0x04` — the documented deposit cells — MOVE between
  consecutive frames (`60672 → 51456`, `122880 → 136448`).
* **The kernel is live.** 30 rows differ, all of them in `iw 3..38`, and cell `0x06` moves.
* **Everything from `iw39` on is bit-identical**, including the entire body: over `iw 84..400`,
  44 cells seen, **0 moved**, 0 of 105 rows differ.
* The body's pickup cell `0x05` is **static** at −456930 — and −456930 is exactly the operand the
  EQ's band-0 words were multiplying. The body reads its input; the input never changes.

⇒ The break is **between iw38 and iw39**, in the shared kernel that every effect runs.

## 3. The word, and why it does nothing (READ FROM THE DEVICE, then MEASURED)
`iw38 = 809.0.00.839`. Its `lo12` is `0x839`, and `upd6383.cpp:2754` reads **lo12 bit 11 as
"addressing only, no ALU effect"**: the branch advances the cursor and the pointer and `return`s
before any action runs. So `iw38`'s **`ACT 0x19` (tempA capture) never fires**. The trace shows the
consequence directly: the `tA` column reads `F65100` on every row of every frame, and `iw39`
(`SRC 0x19` = tempA) consumes that frozen `−634624` — which `iw44` then stores into `0x05`, the
body's pickup. One stale register, and the whole signal path downstream of it is a constant.

The corpus population of that branch is tiny: **95 of 3057 words carry lo12 bit 11, and only TWO
carry a capture action** — one of which is this shared-kernel word. So the reading's blast radius
is two words, and one of them sits on every effect's audio path.

## 4. The arm, with its criterion registered before the run
`UPD6383_LO12CAP` (default OFF): a bit-11 word whose ACT is `0x19` still performs its tempA
capture. **What it captures is the open half of the code** — `upd6383d.h` grades ACT 0x19 as
"tempA ← ??? : ships on the OWNER'S DECISION". The accumulator is the only input-dependent
quantity at `iw38` (its `acc` differs between frames; its `mem` and stale `L` do not), and the
HLE's input stage wants precisely "scale the kernel's accumulated audio and deposit it", which is
what `iw39` (multiply) and `iw44` (store to `0x05`) then do. So the arm captures `acc`.

**Pre-registered, two-sided:** with the arm the body must STOP being frame-identical; if it stays
identical the reading is wrong.

**RESULT — the criterion passed.** With `UPD6383_LO12CAP=1` (FIRED 1 759 822 times, i.e. once per
frame per unit, as a single kernel word should):

| | cells moved (body `iw 84..400`) | rows differing |
|---|---|---|
| shipped | **0 of 44** | 0 of 105 |
| arm on | **3** (`0x05`, `0x50`, `0x51`) | **15 of 105** |

and over the whole frame 6 cells move instead of 3. **For the first time the body is running on
live audio.** The three moving cells are the pickup and band 0's x-history, and they behave as a
shift register should: `0x51 → 0x50 → 0x05` carry `4894193 → 4899512 → 4904730` across the pair —
each frame the sample moves one position along, with the slow increment of a held note.

## 5. The next blocker, already visible in the same trace
Band 0's **y-history rails**: `0x52 = 0x7FFFFF`, `0x53 = 0x3FFFFF`, and the accumulator crosses
the ±2³⁹ clamp inside the band's MAC chain (`iw93` computes 868 693 062 138 against a clamp of
549 755 813 888). With the y feedback at the rail the band's output is a constant, so nothing
propagates past band 0 — which is why bands 1–4 are still frame-identical.

That is the **scale** question, and it is the one `N-SINGLE-DELAY-RECURRENCE §10` already answered
arithmetically from the ROM cells: the EQ's coefficients only realise a flat band when `b0`, `b2`
are scaled ×4 and `b1` ×2 relative to the a-path, and no single shift (and neither candidate
selector) produces that. The two threads have met: **the gate is open, and the first thing the
live signal hits is the unresolved scale.**

## 6. The scale fix was tried on the live body — and the prediction FAILED (MEASURED)
`UPD6383_EQSCALE` (default off, and marked in the source as never-to-ship) applies §10's solved
scales — `b0`, `b2` ×4 and `b1` ×2 — **by the coefficient's position in the band** (`cursor % 6`,
using the EQ's known cell order). That is deliberately fitted: the chip cannot know a
coefficient's role, so the probe is not a decode. Its only job was to answer what arithmetic
cannot — *fed those numbers, does the device produce a working filter?* Pre-registered: the
y-history stops railing, the per-band gain falls from 2.0 to ~1, movement reaches all five bands.

**All three failed.** With the probe on (FIRED 21 220 974) the capture is indistinguishable from
the probe off: band 0's `−a1` operand is still `8388607`, the same three cells move (`0x05`,
`0x50`, `0x51`), the same 15 of 105 rows differ, and bands 1–4 stay at the rail.

**What that refutes is an assumption of mine, and it is worth more than the numbers.** §10's
flatness solve is arithmetic about a **Direct-Form-I biquad**: it says those five ROM cells, used
as `y = b0·x + b1·x1 + b2·x2 − a1·y1 − a2·y2`, are flat only under that scaling. But the device's
own measured behaviour contradicts the same model *before* any scaling: with the coefficients as
stored, DF-I predicts a band gain near **¼**, and the trace measures **2.0** — a factor of eight.
A model that is off by 8 cannot have its inputs corrected by 4. ⇒ **the device is not evaluating
the EQ as the DF-I I assumed**, and §10's numbers cannot be applied to it word-by-word until the
program's actual topology is read out of the bytecode rather than assumed from the cell names.
(That is a bytecode question — exactly the kind the project's own rule says outranks the HLE.)

**And the railing itself needs no scale mystery.** `acc_to_datum()` clamps the *datum*, not the
accumulator: the 44-bit accumulator has headroom, but a band's output is converted to 24 bits and
clipped at ±2²³. With a per-band gain of 2 and five bands in cascade, any real input is amplified
~32× and clips — which is precisely the observed pattern (bands 2–4 with 3 of 5 operands at the
rail). Fix the gain and the railing goes with it; the gain is the open item, not the clamp.

## 7. A SECOND gate, at the body → output-stage boundary (MEASURED)
The same instrument, pointed at the epilogue. With the input gate open **and** the class-8 post-sum
scale on (so the body is fully live — all five EQ bands propagating, 59 of 105 body rows differing
between frames), the **output stage is still completely static**:

```
python3 dsp/tools/frame_pair_diff.py eq_c8_F.log eq_c8_F1.log --lo 60 --hi 83
   cells seen: 2   MOVED: 0        per-row tuples differing: 0 of 22
```

So the chain is now: audio → kernel → **body (live)** → ✗ → epilogue → output. The break is visible
row by row in the trace:

* the body ends with a live accumulator — `iw186` (the makeup multiply/store) leaves
  `acc = 95 987 382`, `iw187` loads `acc = −95 944 704`, `iw188` is the END-OF-BLOCK word;
* the epilogue opens at `iw60` with `acc = 1 301 505 024` — a constant, not the body's value — and
  at `iw65` a `f31 = 0` LOAD takes `P = 0`, so **`acc = 0` from `iw65` onward**;
* `iw73` (`E30.C.00.404`, `SRC 0x10` = the accumulator) is the unit-0 presentation, and it
  presents that zero. `iw72` fetches `L = 0x400000` = the documented unit-0 OUTPUT LEVEL (+0.5),
  so the level is right there and is multiplied into nothing.

The epilogue's reads are **mode-1 register-file addresses** (`0x8D`, `0x8C`, `0x8F`, `0x06`,
`0x85`, `0x90`) while its pointer sits at `dp = 0x00` — i.e. the handover is meant to go through
the REGISTER FILE, not through D-RAM. That is the same array the chorus's delay datum was found
landing in unread (`N-DLYSEED2-CHORUS-CONFRONT §7`): mode-1 stores go to `m_rf[]` under mask bit
23, and nothing on the operand side reads it back. ⇒ **the body→epilogue handoff is the next
single-point break, and it is a register-file question, not an arithmetic one.**

⚠ Grade: MEASURED (two captures, the pair differing in the body and identical in the epilogue, on
the same rig that shows both gates). The *mechanism* is a READ of the words plus the standing
`m_rf` finding — it names where to look, it is not a decode. §221's E1 "epilogue/handover operand
provenance" census is the instrument already built for exactly this.

## 8. Where the live signal actually stops: the L→R CHANNEL BOUNDARY (MEASURED)
§7 said "the body is live but the output stage is static" and pointed at the body→epilogue
handoff. Diffing the frame pair **in execution order** rather than by `iw` locates it exactly, and
it is earlier than that:

```
rows compared 187, differing 99
   n    3..3     iw 3..3
   n    7..31    iw 7..31
   n   35..44    iw 35..44
   n   46..108   iw 46..142     <- last live row
   (nothing from n=109 / iw143 onward)
```
(The frame's real execution order is `iw 0..49` → `iw 84..188` (the body) → `iw 50..81`, so a diff
ordered by `iw` mixes the kernel's two halves; ordering by `n` does not.)

`iw142/143` is the **L→R channel boundary of the EQ body**: `w57 = ld.st acc,(p)+84` steps the
pointer from the L state block to the R one (`dp 0x10 → 0x64`) and `w58 = rstcur` restarts the
coefficient cursor (`cur 0x1E → 0x00`, visible in the trace). So the **L channel is live and the R
channel never receives input** — its first operand cell `0x64` sits static at 18535 — and the
epilogue presents the R result, which is why §7 saw a dead output stage.

**The kernel's own structure says where the R deposit is.** It carries TWO matching `lo12`-bit-11
triplets, identical word forms differing only in `addr8`:

| | L | R |
|---|---|---|
| `ACT 0x01` | `w42 0801070821` addr8 `0x70` | `w50 0801050821` addr8 `0x50` |
| `ACT 0x07` | `w43 080106C827` addr8 `0x6C` | `w51 0801064827` addr8 **`0x64`** |
| `ACT 0x05` | `w44 0801025825` addr8 `0x25` | `w52 0801025825` addr8 `0x25` |

⚠ **CORRECTED by the execution order: the two triplets are not L and R, they are IN and OUT.**
The first (`w42..w44`) runs in `iw0..49`, *before* the body. The second (`w50..w52`) runs at
`n=155+`, *after* it — and the trace shows it holding `acc = −95 944 704`, **the body's own final
accumulator**. So the second triplet is the **body→epilogue handoff** §7 was looking for, and it is
suppressed by this same bit-11 branch. The symmetry of the two triplets is a symmetry of the
input and output stages, not of two channels.

**And the R channel's input is a distinct, still-dead cell.** Diffing the kernel-region cells
across the frame pair: `0x01`, `0x04`, `0x05`, `0x06`, `0x10` **move**; `0x0E` (19 859) and `0x0F`
(18 535) are **static** — and 18 535 is exactly what the R channel's first operand reads (cells
`0x64`/`0x65` carry the same value). So `0x0F` is the R pickup, the mirror of the L pickup `0x05`,
and it is still frozen: `LO12CAP=1` released one capture and brought **one** channel to life.

**Arm extended to the ACT-0x07 store — and it FIRED ZERO TIMES.** `UPD6383_LO12CAP=2` performs the
`ACT 0x07` store on bit-11 words; the count is 0 and the frame pair is unchanged (59 of 105 rows,
identical to `=1`). The reason is in the device and is itself informative: those two words have
`lo12 == 0x827`, which the **§116 branch catches first** (`m_ovc = addr8; return;` — "a register
aimed") under a mask bit that is set by default. ⇒ `w51` does not store; it **aims a register at `0x64`**. The live
candidates in that triplet are therefore `w50` (`ACT 0x01`) and `w52` (`ACT 0x05`), both of which
DO fall into the bit-11 "addressing only" branch and are suppressed there — the same suppression
that held the first gate shut. Since that triplet is the OUTPUT handoff (above), releasing it is
what should carry the body's result to the epilogue; the R channel's input needs the *other*
missing capture, the mirror of the one `LO12CAP=1` released.

⚠ Grade: the stop point, the triplet table, the execution-order correction and the static/moving
cell census are MEASURED. The zero-fire is a MEASURED negative whose cause was then READ from the
device (§116). ⇒ there are **two** remaining suppressed handoffs, both in the shared kernel and both
behind the same bit-11 branch: the **R-channel input** (mirror of the released capture; its cell is
`0x0F`) and the **body→epilogue output** (`w50`/`w52`). §7's framing is corrected: the output break
is real, but it is one of two, not the only one. The arm stays default-off with its zero count.

## 9. ⚠ CORRECTION: the triplets are POINTER SETUP, and only ONE kernel word was ever suppressed
Two further arms were built and both **fired zero times**: `LO12CAP=2` (bit-11 `ACT 0x07` stores)
and `LO12CAP=3` (bit-11 `ACT 0x05` stores under the pointer). Chasing *why* corrects §8's central
claim, and the correction is worth more than either arm.

**Read the disassembly of the seven words instead of inferring from their fields:**
```
  w38   0809000839   ?word                 <- UNDECODED  (the one LO12CAP=1 released)
  w42   0801070821   ldptr   #$70          <- DECODED
  w43   080106C827   ?word   (register write, selector lo12[7:0] = 0x27)
  w44   0801025825   ldptr.d #$25          <- DECODED
  w50   0801050821   ldptr   #$50          <- DECODED
  w51   0801064827   ?word   (register write, selector 0x27)
  w52   0801025825   ldptr.d #$25          <- DECODED
```
So the "triplets" are **pointer-setup sequences** — `ldptr`, a register write, `ldptr.d` — not data
deposits. `w42`/`w44`/`w50`/`w52` are DECODED words, and the device's bit-11 branch lives inside
`if (m_speculative && !alu_decoded(word))`: **a decoded word never reaches it.** That is why both
arms fired zero: those words were never suppressed in the first place.

⇒ **§8's "two suppressed handoffs remain, both behind the same bit-11 branch" is WRONG and is
withdrawn.** Of the kernel's seven bit-11 words exactly **one** — `w38` — was ever suppressed, and
`LO12CAP=1` released it. The second pickup (`0x0F`) and the body→epilogue handoff are still dead,
but **not for this reason**, and the bit-11 branch has nothing further to give.

**What is genuinely still open there** is the pair `w43`/`w51` (`?word`, "register write, selector
0x27"), which §116 consumes as `m_ovc = addr8; return;`. Their values are `0x6C` and `0x64` — and
`0x64` is exactly the second channel's state-block base. In the device `m_ovc` is consulted only
for one wrap bit, so whatever those words really write is unread. That, not the bit-11 branch, is
the next target.

⚠ Grade: the listing quotations and the `alu_decoded` gate are READ from the sources; the two
zero-fire counts are MEASURED. The correction is to my own §8. No decode changed; both arms stay
default-off with their zero counts recorded.

## Honest grade
§2 and §4's result are MEASURED, with a pre-registered two-sided criterion and a null (the shipped
device produces identical frames on the same rig). §3 is READ from the device plus MEASURED in the
trace (`tA` frozen, `iw39` consuming it). **The captured SOURCE is SPECULATIVE** — that ACT 0x19
takes the accumulator is a reasoned choice among {bus, acc, P}, motivated by the HLE's input stage
and by which quantity is input-dependent; the arm is default-off and changes no shipped decode.
⚠ What this does NOT establish: that the chip's ACT 0x19 reads the accumulator, that the value now
reaching the body is numerically right, or that any effect yet produces correct audio. It
establishes that one word's suppressed action is what holds the gate shut, and that releasing it
lets the body run.
§6 is a MEASURED refutation with its criterion registered in advance, and what it refutes is my own
DF-I assumption behind §10 — the flatness solve stays true of the ROM cells under DF-I and becomes
UNPROVEN as a statement about this device. The probe stays default-off and is marked never-to-ship.
