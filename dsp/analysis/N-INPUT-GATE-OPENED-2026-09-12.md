# The audio gate: located at ONE word, opened behind a diagnostic (2026-09-12)

The project's #1 open item is the "4.2 audio gate" — external audio reaches the DSP but never the
effect body, so every program computes on stale state. This note localizes the break to a **single
instruction word** with a two-sided instrument, opens it behind a default-off arm, and reports what
the next blocker is. Companion to `N-SINGLE-DELAY-RECURRENCE-2026-09-12.md` (the scale thread,
which this turns out to meet).

## 1. The instrument: a frame-pair diff (`dsp/tools/frame_pair_diff.py`)
Capture frame F and frame F+1 with an otherwise identical command line and diff every D-RAM cell
and every `(iw, acc, P, L)` row. **A body fed live audio cannot produce two identical frames.**
This replaces judgement calls ("the operands look starved") with a two-sided test, and its exit
status is non-zero on a static body so it can gate a harness.

Capture (PARAMETRIC EQ, real note, unseeded):
```
DISPLAY=:0 DHLE=0 DSPCFG=3 TYPEIDX=15 NOTEMODE=0 TGM=0 UPD6383_PSHIFT=2 \
  UPD6383_TRACE_FRAME=1764000 ./kn7000 kn5000 -rompath ./roms -skip_gameinfo -log -window \
  -autoboot_script dsp/tools/fx_ab.lua ; cp error.log F.log        # then 1764001 -> F1.log
python3 dsp/tools/frame_pair_diff.py F.log F1.log --lo 0 --hi 400
```

## 2. What it measured (BASELINE, shipped device)
* **The audio arrives.** Cells `0x01` and `0x04` — the documented deposit cells — MOVE between
  consecutive frames (`60672 → 51456`, `122880 → 136448`).
* **The kernel is live.** 30 rows differ, all of them in `iw 3..38`, and cell `0x06` moves.
* **Everything from `iw39` on is bit-identical**, including the entire body: over `iw 84..400`,
  44 cells seen, **0 moved**, 0 of 105 rows differ.
* The body's pickup cell `0x05` is **static** at −456930 — and −456930 is exactly the operand the
  EQ's band-0 words were multiplying. The body reads its input; the input never changes.

⇒ The break is **between iw38 and iw39**, in the shared kernel that every effect runs.

## 3. The word, and why it does nothing (READ FROM THE DEVICE, then MEASURED)
`iw38 = 809.0.00.839`. Its `lo12` is `0x839`, and `upd6383.cpp:2754` reads **lo12 bit 11 as
"addressing only, no ALU effect"**: the branch advances the cursor and the pointer and `return`s
before any action runs. So `iw38`'s **`ACT 0x19` (tempA capture) never fires**. The trace shows the
consequence directly: the `tA` column reads `F65100` on every row of every frame, and `iw39`
(`SRC 0x19` = tempA) consumes that frozen `−634624` — which `iw44` then stores into `0x05`, the
body's pickup. One stale register, and the whole signal path downstream of it is a constant.

The corpus population of that branch is tiny: **95 of 3057 words carry lo12 bit 11, and only TWO
carry a capture action** — one of which is this shared-kernel word. So the reading's blast radius
is two words, and one of them sits on every effect's audio path.

## 4. The arm, with its criterion registered before the run
`UPD6383_LO12CAP` (default OFF): a bit-11 word whose ACT is `0x19` still performs its tempA
capture. **What it captures is the open half of the code** — `upd6383d.h` grades ACT 0x19 as
"tempA ← ??? : ships on the OWNER'S DECISION". The accumulator is the only input-dependent
quantity at `iw38` (its `acc` differs between frames; its `mem` and stale `L` do not), and the
HLE's input stage wants precisely "scale the kernel's accumulated audio and deposit it", which is
what `iw39` (multiply) and `iw44` (store to `0x05`) then do. So the arm captures `acc`.

**Pre-registered, two-sided:** with the arm the body must STOP being frame-identical; if it stays
identical the reading is wrong.

**RESULT — the criterion passed.** With `UPD6383_LO12CAP=1` (FIRED 1 759 822 times, i.e. once per
frame per unit, as a single kernel word should):

| | cells moved (body `iw 84..400`) | rows differing |
|---|---|---|
| shipped | **0 of 44** | 0 of 105 |
| arm on | **3** (`0x05`, `0x50`, `0x51`) | **15 of 105** |

and over the whole frame 6 cells move instead of 3. **For the first time the body is running on
live audio.** The three moving cells are the pickup and band 0's x-history, and they behave as a
shift register should: `0x51 → 0x50 → 0x05` carry `4894193 → 4899512 → 4904730` across the pair —
each frame the sample moves one position along, with the slow increment of a held note.

## 5. The next blocker, already visible in the same trace
Band 0's **y-history rails**: `0x52 = 0x7FFFFF`, `0x53 = 0x3FFFFF`, and the accumulator crosses
the ±2³⁹ clamp inside the band's MAC chain (`iw93` computes 868 693 062 138 against a clamp of
549 755 813 888). With the y feedback at the rail the band's output is a constant, so nothing
propagates past band 0 — which is why bands 1–4 are still frame-identical.

That is the **scale** question, and it is the one `N-SINGLE-DELAY-RECURRENCE §10` already answered
arithmetically from the ROM cells: the EQ's coefficients only realise a flat band when `b0`, `b2`
are scaled ×4 and `b1` ×2 relative to the a-path, and no single shift (and neither candidate
selector) produces that. The two threads have met: **the gate is open, and the first thing the
live signal hits is the unresolved scale.**

## Honest grade
§2 and §4's result are MEASURED, with a pre-registered two-sided criterion and a null (the shipped
device produces identical frames on the same rig). §3 is READ from the device plus MEASURED in the
trace (`tA` frozen, `iw39` consuming it). **The captured SOURCE is SPECULATIVE** — that ACT 0x19
takes the accumulator is a reasoned choice among {bus, acc, P}, motivated by the HLE's input stage
and by which quantity is input-dependent; the arm is default-off and changes no shipped decode.
⚠ What this does NOT establish: that the chip's ACT 0x19 reads the accumulator, that the value now
reaching the body is numerically right, or that any effect yet produces correct audio. It
establishes that one word's suppressed action is what holds the gate shut, and that releasing it
lets the body run.
